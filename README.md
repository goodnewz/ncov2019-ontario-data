# Update

## March 30, 2020

Ministry of Health has updated the source data they use to report cases. As a result, there was a slight revision to the numbers reported for March 29, 2020. The biggest change is to the number of positive case (going up from 1,324 to 1,706), cases resolved (going up from 8 to 431) as well as the number of cases under investigation (going down from 7,203 to 5,651). There was also a slight revision to the number of test conducted (revised downward by about 1,000 cases) and number of negative cases (going up by 20).

# Archived data

Ministry of Health has stopped publishing details of each case on their website. As a result I am moving this data to archives as it would not updated any longer. Archived data can be found in the archived folder. See update note for March 30, 2020 for more details.

## cases_ts.csv

Time series data of cased details by day. There is a lot of missing data especially for more recent cases. Unfortunately, as far as I know, the Ministry does not publish updates to the data so I cannot update the case details.
